### Dev Process

* Use small feature branches for development.
* When a feature is complete and ready to be merged, initiate a Pull Request on
  GitHub to merge your `feature_branch` *into* the `master` branch. Other team
  members will then review your changes.
* Once everyone agrees the feature is good to go, merge your branch.

### Continuous Integration

Travis is used for automated builds. Travis is setup up to automatically run
the test suite for each push to the repository, and for each pull requests. A
pull request will not be accepted if any spec is failing.
