          The goal of the challenge is to get more people to go by bike, foot or transit. So we focus on the percentage of employees in your business that are going to work each day by bike, foot or transit. It is pretty simple to track. We will take the total number of employees in your business and multiply that by the number of days in the challenge (five work days per week) to determine the total # of commute trips made by your employees during the challenge (if you can count up the total vacation days we will be able to reduce the total trips days to get an accurate number of bike/ped/bus trips). You and your co-workers track the number of trips to and from work by bike, foot or bus and we will calculate your business’ overall percentage of commutes to and from work by bike, foot or bus. The businesses in each class with the highest percentage of commutes by bike, foot and bus win.

          We have divided the teams into five classes this year. The business classification is based on the total number of employees, not the number of employees in your office that may bike, walk or take the bus. This encourages team captains to get as many people in their business to bike, walk or take the bus (even if it is just one trip a week) as every trip helps increase the percentage of trips by bike, foot or bus.
          <p>
          The Business classes (based on total # of employees) are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>X-Small: 1 &#8211; 4 employees</li>
            <li>Small: 5 &#8211; 15 employees</li>
            <li>Medium: 16 &#8211; 50 employees</li>
            <li>Large: 51 &#8211; 200 employees</li>
            <li>X-Large: More than 200 employees</li>
